# Day 1
On day I wrote the initial draft of Prompt.md and ran it on a medium-low power processor overnight with the parameter: "Read the prompt in the referenced file and act as a pygame designer:"

In the morning I reviewed the assets and files created, completely reinstalled and rebuilt my python environment, and was very surprised when the prompt was essentially satisfied. There are some aspects of the game that need to be improved (asteroid collisions & hit points, game-state lock, asset design). But we have a game to improve. Huzzah!

## Commentary
I suspect many of the retro-arcade games from gaming history are going to work very well with vibe-coding practices, even with no-GPU applications.
